## § Quaestio Prima - Introduction

Frequently, the reader encounters, in socionics, repetitive and exhaustive explanations that attempt to state what a given element, block, dichotomy, or property is. Such descriptions, however, almost always limit themselves to brief, nominal, and mnemonic definitions, offering operational labels that contribute little or nothing to an effective understanding of the system’s underlying structure.

This confers upon them a fundamental characteristic of intellectual fog: a pretentious process, typical of the casual student, which aims at a supposed intellectual enrichment and which, paradoxically, ends up suffocating it. In this context, knowledge gives way to the uncritical repetition of statements, reproduced without any reflective examination or critical attitude toward the object of study itself.

In view of these facts, the object of analysis and teaching of this argument — developed exhaustively — consists in exposing and grounding a didactic approach that allows one to effectively understand what something is, rather than merely repeating the contingent and mnemonic product associated with that object. The underlying foundations of each aspect and their respective representations in different fields of knowledge will be examined rigorously, so as to enable a deep and structured understanding, preventing the reader from falling back into erroneous interpretations. Thus, not only is the reproduction of the arguments presented here permitted, but it is also justified, without conceptual loss or intellectual guilt.

## § Quaestio Secunda - The problem of interpretation

Mortimer Adler, in _How to Read a Book_, examines exhaustively the intellectual process and the rigor necessary for the integral understanding of a book, an article, or even readings undertaken for leisure. He distinguishes four levels of reading: elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical. These processes are not independent, but hierarchical and co-dependent, such that insufficiency in one compromises the others.

The level in which failure most frequently occurs is the analytical, which comprises: the classification of the work (what it is and how it should be read), the general synthesis (the ability to express the whole in a simple manner, as Aristotle did when summarizing Homer’s _Odyssey_), the structure (enumeration and distinction of parts and themes), and the identification of the central problem (the question the author seeks to resolve). We will not delve here into the specific mechanisms of interpretative error, but rather into its fundamental symptom.

### §§ Articulus I - Interpretation and premises within Socionics.

Socionics does not constitute a teleological nor a fatalistic system, nor does it limit itself to describing sociological patterns or behavioral predictions. Categories such as introversion and extroversion do not operate, in this field, as labels of social conduct, but as epistemological structures that express distinct modes of apprehension and metabolism of the object.

Thus, we are not dealing with behavioral projections, but with interpretative structures: formal processes that, although they manifest in diverse material contents, preserve a structural homology. A process organized from 1 to 4 is, in this sense, parallel to other processes equally organized from 1 to 4, not by material identity, but by formal equivalence, which explains why distinct manifestations may present similar interpretative patterns in their cognitive causes and in their comprehensional consequences.

#### §§§ Articulus I.I - Where do we, by logic, enter the error of interpretation?

We do not propose to expose exhaustively all points that are manifestly mistaken or poorly interpreted by others, but rather to reorient the reader’s perception so that it acquires conceptual consistency and is converted into a clear and refined interpretation. At the end, we will present a synthetic exposition of each element (IMEs), allowing direct access to the explanation without structural loss.

## § Quaestio Tertia - On the elements and their foundations

The eight elements are known to anyone who studies — or has studied — socionics: Se, Si, Te, Ti, among others. Their respective mnemonics and denominations are also widely disseminated across different schools (SHS, SCS, WSS, etc.). From this, the question commonly arises: which should we choose?

This question, however, is poorly formulated. The different schools do not describe distinct objects, but the same object of study, employing different descriptive languages and schemes. The divergence is nominal and methodological, not ontological. When the elements are considered at the postulational level, the descriptions converge upon the same formal result, even though they are expressed through different avenues. For example:

_Aushra_:

> Information about actions and deeds, physical activity, the activity of animate and inanimate objects. This perception provides an ability to assess situations one gets exposed to. It determines one’s knowledge of possible methods of action, and an ability or inability to personally come up with such methods. It also determines one’s ability or inability to direct others’ work and to distinguish rational actions from irrational ones.

_WSS:_

> Factually-informed processes. Any working body or mechanism is made up of moving parts that change in their properties. Continuous observation of such processes provides data on how the thing works, its effects and how it can be improved. Such data is factual and concrete, being clearly substantiated in observation. The larger the quantity of data and the more often it is updated, the better the decisions that can be made, increasing the efficiency of these processes.

_SHS:_

> The communicative aspect of P creates a state of excited motion, a thirst for useful activity. In the P-state, a person experiences a rise in productivity, becomes energetic and purposeful. This state is very energy-consuming, so a person who is in it gets nervous and has difficulty restraining himself. Any distraction from work is perceived as a useless waste of time and a loss.

The logical conclusion would appear to be the following: Te concerns movement and work, given the presented premise. This conclusion, however, is mistaken. All analyzed cases consist of contingent products of an implicit premise prior to the description itself, that is, they do not explicate the primary cause by which Te manifests as work or movement.

To clarify this point, it is necessary to expose the underlying reasoning. Users of Te in high dimension (HD) necessarily and by structural rule possess Ti likewise in high dimension. Te, as a rational element oriented toward the explication of methodologies — as repeatedly described — becomes misinterpreted when compared simplistically with Se, generating a recurrent confusion between work and capacity for work.

This confusion is genuine, since both elements are frequently poorly explained. Formulations such as “Se is force,” “Se is energy,” “Se is beauty,” or “Se is aesthetics” are common. However, both Te and Se are capable of recognizing these same aspects in a body or concrete situation. The difficulty arises when one fails to distinguish the principle by which such aspects are apprehended, leading to insufficient explanations, such as reducing the difference to the claim that “Se is kinetic energy and Te is work.”

From this, the question necessarily arises: what does such a distinction actually explain? And, further, how can these elements be properly differentiated?

## § Quaestio Quarta — On the primary cause of each element

Once the structure of the argument has been properly prepared, we will proceed to the analysis of the points in which error may occur, as well as to the exposition of what each element is in itself, in the Aristotelian sense of the term.

## §§Articulus IV.I - Se

Se is commonly described as an element endowed with energetic principles, responsible for force, beauty, money, or aesthetics. Such descriptions are improper, for they take as essence what are merely contingent effects of its operation.

In the first place, Se is a static element, which implies that its focus does not fall upon mutable processes or dynamic (concrete) flows, but upon objective states of external reality as consolidated data. In this sense, Se does not operate through internal measurement nor through qualitatively felt variation — this belongs to Si, which concerns the experience of sensation in itself, that is, the internal measure by which a bodily state is perceived as pleasant, harmful, or balanced.

In the second place, being extroverted and structurally correlated with Si, Se apprehends reality according to the way in which already-constituted external states exert influence upon systems, environments, or bodies. Every introverted sensation, when coming into contact with an external object that disturbs or threatens homeostasis, is projected into a perception of what that object is like, in terms of weight, density, resistance, or capacity for imposition. It is at this point that Se manifests.

Thus, Se concerns the static evaluation of effective influence present in objective reality — not as a process in progress, but as a given condition. Force, beauty, money, power, or determination are not Se in themselves, but possible material expressions of this influence when apprehended as an objective state. Overcoming, expansion, or defense observed in users of Se base or creative do not constitute the essence of the element, but operative consequences of the static apprehension of these external conditions, whether to affirm influence or to preserve integrity.

A more concrete example: Se may apprehend the measurement of influence in an environment across multiple domains. In an academic context, for instance, such influence may be determined by abstract capacity in a Linear Algebra class, by the apprehension of formal regularities, or by the structural clarity with which a system is understood. In other contexts, influence may manifest as beauty, money, type of car, physical strength, fighting style, or reading ability.

In all these cases, Se does not concern the specific content at stake, but the degree of objective overlap and predominance that a given aspect exerts over an environment, system, or relation. Thus, Se applies to any characteristic that expresses how much an agent or object imposes itself in terms of influence, whether within a regular and formalized system (such as those structured by Ti), or within a direct one-to-one competitive relation, mediated by criteria of interpersonal valuation (Fi).

That is:

> _Se is the principle by which the objective hierarchy of influence among entities within the same field of interaction is apprehended._

## §§ Articulus IV.II - Ne

It may seem surprising, but the common interpretation of Ne proves to be even more problematic than that of Se. Ne is frequently presented as “abilities,” “the essence of phenomena,” or an “evaluation of viability.” Such formulations are imprecise. Ne does not concern persons in themselves, nor essence in the strict sense, but phenomena as possibilities manifested in nature, that is, what may be considered an event, independently of a rational process of validation.

It is necessary, from the outset, to distinguish that qualities and essences are not apprehended immediately or “without thinking.” Every essential determination passes through a rational analytical filter, which involves distinction, separation, and recomposition — something proper to rational aspects. To attribute to Ne direct access to the essence of phenomena is, therefore, a categorical error.

Being extroverted, Ne operates in a manner structurally secondary to Ni. For a holistic abstraction of something to occur, it is necessary first to have a notion of what is present and of how it changes over time. Ne thus refers to the space of possible variations — real or unreal — of events, that is, to the set of configurations that may or may not occur in the world, considered as isolated possibilities.

The probability or effective tendency of these events to occur, in turn, belongs to Ni. Ne does not determine which events will occur, but abstracts possibilities as such, compartmentalizing them and detaching them from the temporal and causal tendencies that would give them direction. It is for this reason that Ne is static: it deals with an aspect secondary to the event itself, not with its processual unfolding.

Ne is often described as the perception of a “holistic picture” of the world. This characterization is only partially correct. Indeed, Ne operates with information about events considered as a complete picture, and this derives from its static nature. However, these events may be real or fictitious, possible or merely conceivable.

The fundamental error lies in associating Ne with the understanding of the essence of things “without thinking.” There is no understanding without interpretation, and all interpretation involves operations proper to rational aspects. In making such an association, Ne is improperly confused with characteristics of Introverted Logic (Ti), whose function is precisely the structural and conceptual apprehension of what something is — a topic that will be addressed later.

That is:

> _Ne is the principle by which the possibilities of an entity are apprehended as static variations of the event, abstracted from their temporal direction._

## §§ Articulus IV.III - Te

Te is, in particular, the most misunderstood element, despite its centrality. As will be shown later, Ti concerns information about causes; Te, consequently, refers to effects. In formal terms, Te deals with the particular manifestations through which the regularities of the world are expressed. Gravity, as a regularity, belongs to Ti; the object falling or the friction generated by the fall constitute Te.

Being dynamic, Te operates in the domain of the production and chaining of effects, which presupposes derivation from regularities observable in everyday life — that is, from their particular implications. It is precisely because it deals with the effective unfolding of these regularities that Te is dynamic. In this sense, it may be described as the operative consequence of actions, that which is obtained when the means–effect nexus is correctly understood, the foundation of all technology: “if I press this button, the computer will shut down.”

Thus, Te is the correct way of apprehending how an action leads to a desired effect, which decisively distinguishes it from Se, which concerns influence as such, without intrinsic direction when considered in isolation from rational principles.

Finally, it is necessary to delimit with precision:

Te is not brute fact, money, prices, market, or wealth.

Te is technology, effects, and specific manifestations of regularities — that is, the concrete operationalization of what is intelligible at the causal level.

That is:

> _Te is the principle by which particular effects derived from causal regularities are apprehended._

## §§ Articulus IV.IV - Fe

If we take as an unequivocal fact that Te is a dynamic element responsible for apprehending effects derived from causal regularities and operative technologies, we may, by structural analogy, understand Fe as the contingent product of the externalization of affective evaluations. Fe does not concern the emotional state itself, but the expressive manifestation of such evaluations, such as the modulation of treatment and behavior toward one or more personal objects.

Thus, when we feel aversion toward something or someone, the logical consequence is distancing, coldness, or indifference; when we evaluate someone positively, we tend toward approach, contact, and warmer treatment. In both cases, explicit reactions and observable behaviors constitute the proper domain of Fe. It is not a matter of the internal evaluation — which belongs to Fi — but of the communicable effect of that evaluation within the intersubjective space, that is, of attitude made visible and interpretable.

That is:

> _Fe is the principle by which the evaluation of an entity becomes communicable expression in the world._

## §§ Articulus IV.V - Si

The information of Si derives from the senses — sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell — as well as from internal sensations associated with bodily well-being, such as comfort, discomfort, tension, or pain. When we feel cold, heat, or pain, we are not interpreting or judging such states; we are merely experiencing them. This immediacy defines Si as irrational.

Moreover, Si deals with states that change over time, not by conceptual abstraction, but by concrete sensory alteration. A pain that intensifies, a sound that grows louder, or a thermal sensation that shifts are examples of variations apprehended by Si. These states can be located in space and time — “now I feel pain,” “at this moment I hear a high-pitched sound.”

Being introverted, Si does not describe the external object as such, but how that object affects the internal state of the body. Two individuals may be exposed to the same material stimulus and yet experience different sensory states. The focus of Si is not the objective influence of the object (Se), nor the evaluation of the stimulus as good or bad (Fi), but the quality of the bodily state produced.

That is:

> _Si is the principle by which internal sensory states are apprehended as direct bodily experience._

## §§ Articulus IV.VI - Ni

Ni is one of the most misunderstood aspects; it is commonly attributed to “futurology,” “prediction of events,” or even vague forms of mysticism and abstraction. Such formulations are imprecise, for they take as essence what are merely contingent mnemonic readings, that is, superficial descriptions of apparent effects rather than of the principle in operation.

Being dynamic, Ni concerns the apprehension of patterns of states that transit and transform over time. It is not a matter of arbitrarily predicting events, but of recognizing tendencies of occurrence through continuous observation of how certain physical states and experiences are sequenced. In this sense, Ni deals with the probability of a phenomenon occurring, considering the recurrence and direction assumed by previously experienced states.

Being introverted, Ni does not describe the external event itself, but the internal continuity of states over time, that is, how a sequence of experiences organizes itself toward a coherent direction. This apprehension is neither rational nor analytical; it occurs through the internalization of temporal flow, through the perception of how something has been configuring itself and where it tends to move.

The structural connection between Ni and Si, within the mental ring, is fundamental. While Si apprehends the present bodily state, Ni observes how these states are maintained, degraded, or stabilized over time. From this relation derives Ni’s orientation toward the preservation of the physical state, toward the containment of excessive variation, and toward the search for equilibrium, avoiding indiscriminate exposure to purely variable realities or to disconnected experiences that succeed one another without direction.

That is:

> _Ni is the principle by which the temporal tendencies of states are apprehended, that is, the probable direction of their transformation over time._

## §§ Articulus IV.VII - Fi

Although, in part, most descriptions of Fi refer to subjective distances and to relationships themselves — which is not entirely incorrect — the process of post-reading derivation of such descriptions leads many to an erroneous conclusion: that Fi would be analogous to Ti, as if Ti concerned objective distance between objects and Fi subjective distance. Such an interpretation is simplistic and absurd when confronted with the actual structure of the system, especially when we observe that Te and Fe can produce exactly the same concrete effects that are imprecisely attributed to Ti and Fi.

Fi, being static and introverted, concerns information that is not concretely tangible, but this does not imply empty abstraction or absence of object. Rather, it concerns evaluations relative to objects, persons, sensations, or events, evaluations that are derived from the prior attention of other aspects present within the same functional block — notably sensation (S) or intuition (N). Thus, statements such as “some changes in the world are good or bad for us” or “this sensation, for me, is pleasant or harmful” precisely express the domain of Fi. This remains consistent when we observe that every type with N or S in high dimension necessarily possesses its dynamic correlate likewise in high dimension.

Every relationship evaluated in direct reference to the self constitutes an evaluation of Fi. This is because Fi operates through internal categorical impressions of acceptance or rejection, of value-based proximity or distance, classifying something as good or bad for oneself. However, the attitude adopted toward someone — approaching, withdrawing, showing affection or coldness — already belongs to the domain of Fe, since it is a dynamic and extroverted aspect. The concrete movement of approach or withdrawal is relational and observable; the evaluation that precedes and grounds it belongs to Fi.

That is:
> Fi is the principle by which something is evaluated as good or bad for oneself, that is, the internal and categorical assessment of value relative to the subject.

## §§ Articulus IV.VIII - Ti

“Rules,” “law,” “systems,” “truth,” “justice,” “hierarchy,” and “order” are mnemonics attributed to Ti in a repeated manner and without consistent theoretical foundation. Whenever Ti is reduced to any of these categorizations, the central content of the aspect as logical and introverted is lost, replaced by normative or institutional labels that are not proper to it — a point on which we will not dwell here.

As a static element, Ti concerns the apprehension of regularities and underlying causes of diverse events and phenomena, abstracted from specific details and not bound to a particular moment in time. Being formally primary to Te, Ti observes the functioning of the world through recurrent causal relations, structuring understanding by means of these regularities and their particular manifestations. Thus, when an object falls to the ground, the concrete event belongs to the domain of Te, whereas the causal regularity — gravity — is apprehended by Ti.

Every exercise of Ti therefore consists in the synthesis of understandings prior to effects, that is, in the formulation of principles that explain why certain effects occur. Each of these syntheses presupposes a prior postulation, from which a primary cause is established. In this sense, the Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophical tradition clearly exemplifies the proper operation of Ti: in investigating why something is what it is, purely contingent details are abstracted in order to reach a first cause, capable of explaining the movement and intelligibility of reality at the metaphysical level.

That is:
> _Ti is the principle by which the underlying causes and regularities of phenomena are apprehended, abstracted from contingent particulars and prior to their effects._

# § Conclusio — On the Correct Intelligibility of the Elements

The manner in which socionics is studied constitutes the central problem analyzed here; only after clarifying this point did it become possible to proceed to the investigation of what the theory of the elements is in itself. The aim was not to exhaust the reader through unnecessary extensions, but to allow, in a direct manner, the extraction from this argument of a fundamental and true content, free from superficial mnemonics and contingent interpretations.

Moreover, no element operates independently of the prevailing block structure. Each type interprets a phenomenon according to the constitution and specific articulation of its blocks, since all blocks interact with one another and produce a particular — and not general — partition of reality. There is, therefore, no neutral or universal reading of the elements, but manifestations conditioned by the structural organization proper to each type.

In this way, the attempt to overexplain individuals on the basis of the elements constitutes a fundamental error, insofar as it ends up justifying behaviors as if socionics were, in its constitution, phenomenological or behavioral, which amounts to a categorical error. The same error occurs in the attempt to fit the individual into rigid typing processes, demanding that they reproduce behaviors associated with a distinct temporal context, thus falling into anachronism and, once again, into a categorical error.

Finally, such an approach also fails by disregarding the central point of the analysis: the understanding of the particular epistemological process by which the individual apprehends and organizes reality. By ignoring the specific use of language, categories, and meanings employed by the subject, the typist abandons structural investigation in favor of superficial and normative descriptions, thereby emptying the theoretical scope of socionics itself.

Therefore, it is the integral responsibility of the individual to produce the correct interpretation, as elucidated here, in order not to reproduce coarse and intellectually impoverished patterns of behavior, such as the claim that one is “using an element” to perform a given task. Such a formulation is not only mistaken, but reveals conceptual ignorance, as it denotes a complete misunderstanding of the structural nature of the elements and of the theory as a whole.

The irony lies in the fact that this type of discourse seeks to demonstrate technical mastery, when, in reality, it evidences lack of study, uncritical reading, and adherence to empty mnemonics. By treating the elements as voluntary tools or activatable states, the epistemological meaning of socionics is entirely lost, once again falling into the categorical error that this work set out to dismantle from the outset.
